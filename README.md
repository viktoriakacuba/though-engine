# 🧠 Thought Engine

A minimal but powerful Vue 3 SPA that simulates a reasoning process step-by-step — designed as a **live showcase** for UI clarity, UX intelligence, and frontend thinking.

> Built for interviews, product demos, and those who want to show not just what they think — but *how* they think.

## Why It Exists

Most reasoning UIs focus on answers, not process. Thought Engine simulates how high-level thinkers break down ideas — ideal for showcasing logical depth, not just output.

## Use Case

Useful in interview challenges, product discovery sessions, or AI interface prototyping — anywhere clear, structured thought is required.

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Re-run any previous idea or thought
- 📜 Dynamic step-by-step reasoning (philosophy meets UX)
- 🧩 Persona switcher (Strategist, Philosopher, etc.)
- 💡 Clean UI with focus on logic, clarity, and depth
- 💾 Export to JSON (soon: Markdown / PDF)
- 🚀 Vue 3 + Tailwind + Vite (blazing fast)

## 🧠 Personas (Modes)

Each persona provides a distinct lens of thinking:

| Persona     | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Strategist  | Structured reasoning with goals and trade-offs   |
| Philosopher | Abstract logic, ethics, and long-term reflection |
| Investor    | ROI mindset, risk/reward frameworks               |
| Shadow      | Unfiltered & primal — the raw thoughtstream      |
